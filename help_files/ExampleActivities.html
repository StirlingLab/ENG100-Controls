      For each activity, consider what was challenging and what was easier. In what scenarios might open vs. closed loop controllers be used? How did the different PID gains affect the ability to achieve the task?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Activity 1:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Select open loop control and start with gravity off.
        </li>
          You can set how much current to use and how long to apply it for.
        <li>
          Using one motion try to get the angle to 45.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you are happy with that, try again to get it to 135.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now turn on gravity and try to repeat it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Activity 2:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Select closed loop control and start with gravity off.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can modify the proportional term gain and the desired angle to see the effects  on system performance. (Set the integral and derivative gains to zero.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Replicate the previous activity of going to 45 and 135.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now turn on gravity and try to repeat it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat this activity with inclusion and modifications to the integral and derivative gains.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
