    <h1>Open Loop Control</h1>
    <p>
      In this interface, the open loop control input is the current command magnitude applied for a specified time duration. You can modify either of these two inputs to observe the final position of the system.

    <p>
      <b>Current Command:</b> The amount of electrical current applied to the motor. This value is proportional to the torque (a rotational force that is applied to the system).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Time Duration:</b> The length of time for which the current command is applied.  After this time runs out, the current applied will be zero.
