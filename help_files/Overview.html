      This interface provides a way to explore the differences between open loop and closed loop control systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In open loop control, the output has no influence on the input signal. You can set the input and the input will not change based on the output that occurs. An example is a radiator, you open a valve, which lets heat increase or decrease, but the valve wonâ€™t change based on the temperature of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In closed loop systems, the input can change based on the output. Sensors or mechanical designs can enable the input to be adjusted based on the output. A modern thermostat is closed loop as it uses the temperature of the room to modulate the air flow.
